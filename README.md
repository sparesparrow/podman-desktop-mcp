# Podman Desktop Extension Full Template

</p>

## Overview

This template provides a "full" example of creating an extension with a webview that utilizes multiple packages. Within this template, we use three separate packages to distinguish between the frontend, backend, and shared code that connects the frontend and backend.

The "full" template is meant to showcase a full production example which includes multiple frontend and backend technologies such as TypeScript, Svelte and TailwindCSS.

All backend-related code can be separated into its own package, which improves both security and code organization.

The template offers flexibility in creating a Podman Desktop extension that can use the underlying Podman Desktop API and pre-built UI components via [@podman-desktop/ui-svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@podman-desktop/ui-svelte).

With this template, it's as easy as:
* **Backend:** Write 100% TypeScript code.
* **Frontend:** Use Svelte & pre-made UI components from Podman Desktop for rapid UI development.

Tips for using this template:
* Every section is heavily commented to aid understanding. Start with the `backend`, then move on to the `frontend`, and finally explore the `shared` package.
* Adding a new function to connect the frontend and backend requires updates to both `packages/backend/src/api-impl.ts` and `packages/shared/src/HelloWorldApi.ts`.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack for this extension template includes:

* TypeScript
* Svelte 5
* TailwindCSS
* npm

## Architecture

The template is organized into three packages:

* `packages/frontend`: A Svelte/Tailwind-based frontend designed for easy integration with the Podman Desktop official [@podman-desktop/ui-svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@podman-desktop/ui-svelte) package.
* `packages/backend`: The backend code and central configuration area for the extension, managed within `package.json`.
* `packages/shared`: Intermediary code that creates a connection between the frontend and backend via an RPC connection.

## Development

To build and develop the extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project or your fork:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-extension-template-webview/
```

2. Run `npm install` to install all relevant packages:
```sh
$ npm install
```

3. Create a build:

Creating a build will generate all required files for Podman Desktop to load the extension:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

In the `package.json` and `vite.config.js` files, we create a directory in `/packages/backend/media` that contains all the webview components. You will see output like the following:

```sh
$ npm run build
...

[0] ✓ built in 1.49s
[0] npm run -w packages/frontend build exited with code 0
✨  Done in 3.02s.
```

These files will be loaded from the extension.

Optionally, you can also use `npm run watch` to continuously rebuild after each change, without needing to re-run `npm build`:

```sh
$ npm run watch
```

4. Load the extension within Podman Desktop:

We will load the extension within Podman Desktop to test it. This requires Podman Desktop v1.17+

1. Navigate to the settings and enable `Development Mode` for the `extensions`
1. Click on the `extensions` nav item in the left navigation bar
1. Go to the `Local extension` tab.
1. Click on the 'Add a local folder...' button and select the path of the `packages/backend` folder of this extension and click OK.
1. Now the extension is part of Podman Desktop and you can see it listed in the `installed` tab of the Extensions panel.


5. Confirm that the extension has been loaded:

You will now see a "Hello World" webview in the Podman Desktop navbar. You can also check the developer console for any logging information indicating that the extension has been loaded successfully.

Example of extension loading:

## Linter, Typecheck, and Formatter

We include additional tools to assist in development, which can be found in the main `package.json` file.

Formatter:
```sh
$ npm run format:fix
```

Linter:
```sh
$ npm run lint:fix
```

Typechecker:
```sh
$ npm run typecheck
```

## Packaging and Publishing

More information on how to package and publish your extension can be found in our [official publishing documentation](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/extensions/publish).

However, we have provided a pre-made Containerfile in this template for you to try.

1. Package your extension by building the image:

```sh
$ podman build -t quay.io/myusername/myextension .
```

2. Push the extension to an external registry:

```sh
$ podman push quay.io/myusername/myextension
```

3. Install via the Podman Desktop "Install Custom..." button:
